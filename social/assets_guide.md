# Social Assets Guide

## Hero / Preview Image
- Use `BANANA.png` (already in repo) for top-of-README and social cards.
- Recommended alt text: "Smart image refiner demo output".

## Demo GIF/Video (recommended)
- Length: 15–30s
- Show: before image → 2-3 iterations → final score card
- Resolution: 1080x1080 (square) or 1920x1080 (landscape)
- Export: MP4 (H.264) or GIF ≤ 8 MB for X/Reddit

## Social Card (Optional)
- 1200x630 (Open Graph) if you host a site; for GitHub, the README image is sufficient.

## Captions / CTAs
- "Iterates until it passes 8.5+ overall"
- "Face fidelity + anatomy are first-class metrics"
- "One command quick start in README"

## Hashtags / Tags
- #AI #GenerativeAI #ComputerVision #OpenSource #Python #Gemini #ImageEnhancement
